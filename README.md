# A PhotoScreen app for Google Photos

Designed to show a slideshow of all of your google photos in a random order, in such a way as to work on a headless Raspberry Pi Zero.

WARNING:

This is designed to be installed on an installed Raspberry PI. IT SHOULD NOT BE USED ON A PUBLIC WEB SERVER.
The reason is that the client_id from Google is stored in the front end Javascript and so isn't very secure.
